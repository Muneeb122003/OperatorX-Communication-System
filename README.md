# OperatorX – Customer Communication Simulation

**OperatorX** is a C++ console-based application that simulates mobile customer operations. It allows users to manage calls, messages, internet usage, billing, and operator changes through a simple menu-driven interface. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as **classes, objects, encapsulation, and interaction between objects**.

## Features

- **Create Customers and Operators** – Initialize multiple customers and operators with unique attributes.  
- **Make Calls** – Simulate a phone call between customers and automatically deduct the call cost.  
- **Send Messages** – Send messages between customers with balance deduction based on message rates.  
- **Connect to Internet** – Simulate internet usage and deduct charges according to operator rates.  
- **Pay Bills** – Recharge customer balance with user-specified amounts.  
- **Change Operator** – Switch customer’s operator dynamically.  
- **Change Bill Limit** – Modify the customer’s bill limit.  
- **View Customer Details** – Display all customer attributes, including balance, bill limit, and current operator.  

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, Pointers, Encapsulation, Menu-driven Interface  

## How to Use

1. Compile the code using any C++ compiler.  
2. Run the executable.  
3. Use the on-screen menu to simulate customer operations.  
4. Follow prompts to make calls, send messages, connect to the internet, pay bills, or change operator/bill limit.
